Say we want to move a DB from an older version server to a newer version Server.
You must know - Source Server name, Destination Server name and the DB/DBs you want to move.

If it's connected to any web server- Stop service from there --Application Team
Put database to read only, take backup and restore to target server -- DBA team
Change database compatibility level to 130 and db owner to SA -- DBA team
Move service account (EPSNET\prodfederationservic) and SQL Agent job - Migrate Ping Federate Archive to Failover Node (Production) -- DBA team
Change connection string to point to target server -- Application team
Verify connection on the target server -- DBA team
Testing and confirmation -- Application
Put source server database to offline --DBA team
