Say we want to move a DB from an older version server to a newer version Server.
You must know - Source Server name, Destination Server name and the DB/DBs you want to move.

Implementation Plan
ğŸŒ±If it's connected to any web server- Stop service from there --Application Team/Responsible team
ğŸŒ±Put database to read only, take backup and restore to target server -- DBA team
ğŸŒ±Change database compatibility level to newer Server -- DBA team
ğŸŒ±Move service account (related to DBs) and SQL Agent job - Related to DBs -- DBA team
ğŸŒ±Change connection string to point to target server -- Application team
ğŸŒ±Verify connection on the target server -- DBA team
ğŸŒ±Change CNAME to the restored DBs - SysAdmin/Responsible team
ğŸŒ±Testing and confirmation -- Application
ğŸŒ±Put source server database to offline --DBA team
ğŸŒ±Disable the jobs that you just moved from source server.

Backout Plan :: If something bad happens/Couldn't finish in time
ğŸ‘€Remove restored database on target server
ğŸ‘€Change database to ONLINE on source server
ğŸ‘€Update connection string to point to source server
