# SQL Server Migration Plan
## Migration Plan
The main goal of many organizations, today, is reducing costs while maintaining the highest degree of stability and efficiency. To this end, we should think out of the box about how we can help to achieve this as DBAs. The approaches include:

   - Centralization
   - Curtailment the SAN storage
   - Reducing the Microsoft license for Windows and SQL Server

Database Migration is a possible solution to achieve this goal. However, some DBAâ€™s do not have a clear view of the requirements, and the actual steps for how to accomplish this with minimum risks and zero downtime.

#  Locking in SQL Server
Locking is the way that SQL Server manages transaction concurrency. Essentially, locks are in-memory structures which have owners, types, and the hash of the resource that it should protect. A lock as an in-memory structure is 96 bytes in size. 

To understand better the locking in SQL Server, it is important to understand that locking is designed to ensure the integrity of the data in the database, as it forces every SQL Server transaction to pass the ACID test. 

ACID test consists of 4 requirements that every transaction have to pass successfully: 

   - Atomicity â€“ requires that a transaction that involves two or more discrete parts of information must commit all parts or none
   - Consistency â€“ requires that a transaction must create a valid state of new data, or it must roll back all data to the state that existed before the transaction was executed
   - Isolation â€“ requires that a transaction that is still running and did not commit all data yet, must stay isolated from all other transactions
   - Durability â€“ requires that committed data must be stored using method that will preserve all data in correct state and available to a user, even in case of a failure

## Lock modes
Lock mode considers various lock types that can be applied to a resource that has to be locked:
 
    - Exclusive (X)
    - Shared (S)
    - Update (U)
    - Intent (I)
    - Schema (Sch)
    - Bulk update (BU)
